# Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial about the Raspberry Pi microcomputer and its amazing capabilities. This tutorial intends to offer you:

1. An overview of Raspberry Pi – one of the most popular microcomputers in use today.
2. A toe-dipping introduction to the Python programming language.
3. An understanding of Raspberry Pi's physical pins, which we can use to make it talk to all sorts of electronics – from within our Python programs!

It may also be useful as a reference during our hackathon.

We will work through this sheet as follows. For each of the following chapters, the tasks are grouped into **ascending order of difficulty**. Please attempt all tasks under **Mandatory exercises**, and if you have time before we move on, have fun with the **Optional exercises**.

**One plea**: If you are done earlier than your neighbour, please help us out by offering your help to them. Explaining something is a sure-fire way to really understand it yourself!

# An Overview of the Raspberry Pi (RPi)

## What is the Raspberry Pi?

Raspberry Pi is a small computer the size of a credit card that you can plug into a monitor, keyboard and mouse. You can use it in the same way as you would use your desktop PC or laptop. You can generate spreadsheets, do word processing, browse the internet, and play games. It also plays high-definition video.

However, what will make it interesting for us is its capability for use in electronics projects! The main aim of the Raspberry Pi is to teach anyone how to use programming and electronics to realise their ideas. Raspberry Pi comes with a free Linux operating system that runs from an SD card, and it is powered by a USB phone charger.

## Models of Raspberry Pi

Since its original launch in 2012 there have been a number of different models with the most recent model having a quad core processor runnning at 1.4GHz and with 1GB of RAM.
